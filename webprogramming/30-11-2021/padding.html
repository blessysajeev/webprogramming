<p>AMAL JYOTHI COLLEGE<br>
      A top-rated centre of technical higher education, Amal Jyothi is managed by the Catholic Diocese of Kanjirapally. 
Helmed by the visionary and youthful Bishop Mar Mathew Arackal, the diocese has a glorious track record across a broad range of educational and social service activities. One self-financed engineering college, two government-aided arts and science colleges, 17 Higher Secondary Schools, 36 High Schools, 26 Upper Primary Schools, 54 Lower Primary Schools, Five Special Schools, 16 Hospitals, NGOs like Malanadu Development Society, Peermade Development Society and Amala Communications - all enduring paradigms of its matchless achievements. Deep commitment of around 250 priests, 1600 sisters and a sizable number of full-time social
 workers supports the Bishop in his efforts to lead the institutions towards becoming strong pillars of society</p>
